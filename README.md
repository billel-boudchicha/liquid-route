# liquid-routes
This is a collection of route elements which will make it super easy for you to do animated routing.

This mainly consist of the following routes

1. FaderRoute: Next route will fade in and current will fade out.
2. PopRoute: Next route will pop from center and current route will implode
3. SwipeLeft: Next route will pop from center and current route will implode
3. SwipeRight: Next route will pop from center and current route will implode

This library WILL contain what will make animated routes with `preact-router` as easy as Dwayne `The Rock` Johnson giving Rockbottom.
